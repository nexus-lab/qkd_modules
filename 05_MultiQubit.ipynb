For example a quantum computer may have a register that can hold 8 qubits at any given time. We already know how to represent the state of any single qubit in the register. However, if we can represent the state of the entire system we can do much more than what we've seen so far with the qubits. For example, we can now apply two or even three qubit gates that operate on more than one qubit at a time. We can also represent, what are called entangled qubits or EPR pairs after their discovers Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen. EPR pairs are very powerful tools in quantum cryptography and the famous application of quantum teleportation."
