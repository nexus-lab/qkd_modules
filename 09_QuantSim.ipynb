        "Figure 2 shows the circuit diagram and the result of simulation of EPR protocol. A combination of H and CNOT gates are used to create entangled qubits in the state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\rvert00\\rangle+\\rvert11\\rangle)$. Alice randomly measures the first qubit of the entangled pair in  standard or Hadamard basis. In order to measure in the Hadamard basis, like before, Alice applies the H gate before measurement. Similarly Bob measures the second qubit from every EPR pair in the standard or Hadamard basis. Execution results are shown for 8192 shots (maximum number of shots) and match the expected output. The results are stored in two classical registers of 10 bits each called abits and bbits for Alice's and Bob's bits respectively. Now Alice and Bob can execute the remaining classical steps of the protocol.\n",

These gates commute with each other and therefore satify the requirement of $U_aU_b=U_bU_a$. The two orthogonal states agreed upon by Alice and Bob are $\\rvert0\\rangle$ and $\\rvert1\\rangle$. Alice applies a X gate in order to convert the default qubit $\\rvert0\\rangle$ into $\\rvert1\\rangle$ before transmission.\n",
