        "Coding theory and cryptography are two most intricately connected subjects. In several cases, cryptosystems are simply error correction codes for which the decoding matrix forms the key. For example, the post-quantum encryption algorithm called McEllice cryptosystem is based on Goppa codes. There are numerous other examples where polynomial arithmetic is used for encryption and key management. Therefore, it is important for anyone learning cryptography (or quantum cryptography) to be familiar with the theory of quantum error correction codes. This lesson will provide a brief introduction to the topic in order to wet the appetite of the reader. For further details, the reader should refer to books mentioned in the preface of this unit.\n",

        "Qubits are prone to errors during transit from sender to receiver. In classical communication, we only concern ourselves with bit flip errors where a transmitted 0 changes to 1 and vice versa. With qubits we have to theoretically worry about infinite number of possible errors because a qubit is a continuum state described by $\\alpha|0\\rangle+\\beta|1\\rangle$ with $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ being complex numbers. An error in such a qubit would amount to $\\alpha$ changing to some $\\alpha'$ and $\\beta$ changing to $\\beta'$. For the longest time it was believed that such errors cannot be corrected because every value of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ is possible and, therefore, one cannot distinguish between a valid state and an invalid state. However, in 1995 Peter Shor proved everyone wrong by inventing quantum error correction and providing a 9-qubit coding scheme that can correct any arbitrary single qubit error. Later this code was refined to 7-qubit and 5-qubit schemes where the latter is the most efficient a single qubit error correction scheme can be.\n",

Correcting such errors falls under the field of fault-tolerant quantum computing and will not concern us here."

Further, measurement of a single qubit only reveals a bit 0 or a bit 1 and never the actual values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.
