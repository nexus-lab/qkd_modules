It is easy to see that the transmission probability is maximized when the angle that incoming photon makes with the filter's axis of polarization is $45^\\circ$. At this angle, half the photons get transmitted and half get blocked. Therefore, figure 4 reduces the number of transmitted photons by half after every filter.
